# Number Game - ASP.NET

## Overview

This is the beginning of my Number Game project built using ASP.NET. The goal of this project is to create an interactive math game where users select numbers that fit a given operation and yield the correct result.

Currently, the game generates random addition problems, and users must select two numbers whose sum matches the target result.

## Features

- Randomly generated addition problems (0-100).
- Multiple-choice selection of numbers.
- Checks for correct answers.

## Upcoming Features

- [ ] Additional math operations (subtraction, multiplication, division).
- [ ] Timed rounds for a competitive mode.
- [ ] Scoring system based on accuracy and speed.
- [ ] User authentication to track high scores.
- [ ] Enhanced UI/UX for a better gaming experience.
